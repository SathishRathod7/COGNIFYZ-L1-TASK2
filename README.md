**Overview of Descriptive Analysis**

Objectives:           
  1.Statistical Summary: Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns to summarize the dataset.             
  2.Categorical Variable Distribution: Explore and understand the distribution of categorical variables such as "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."               
  3.Top Cuisines and Cities: Identify and rank the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.                 
  
Key Activities:                    
 1.Calculate Statistical Measures                    
  *Compute measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for numerical columns.                     
  *Generate a summary statistics table for quick reference.                         

2.Explore Categorical Variables:                  
  *Count the frequency of each category in categorical columns.               
  *Visualize the distribution of categorical variables using bar charts or pie charts..               

3.Identify Top Cuisines and Cities:               
  *Determine the most popular cuisines based on the number of restaurants.           
  *Identify the cities with the highest concentration of restaurants                      
  
Technology Used:            

Programming Language:                 
  *Python: A versatile programming language widely used for data analysis and preprocessing.               

Libraries and Tools:               
  *Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including handling missing values and data type conversions.              
  *NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.            
  *Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.              
  *Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, particularly useful for exploring and understanding the distribution of variables.
